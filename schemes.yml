    [JDF11] explored using isogenies of degree $ℓ^e$ for various
    choices of $\ell$. It is only with [DJP14] that the choice of
    $ℓ=2,3$ became standard. The choice of having $p = 3 \bmod 4$ and
    of a specific starting curve did not become standard until
    [CLN16].

        Folklore version SIDH, starting from a random curve of unknown
        endomorphism ring.  First published mention in [Pet17],
        however it is currently not known how to generate such a curve
        without a trusted setup (see [BB+22]).

        Folklore version of SIDH where the initiator (Alice) selects a
        random starting curve before starting the key exchange, and
        transmits it along with its public key.  First published
        mention in [BdQ+19], Section 11.1, as a possible
        countermeasure against torsion point attacks (see [Pet17]).
        Also mentioned in [Cos21] for the same reason.

    More compact variant of SIDH exploiting torsion points both on the
    curve and its twist.

    Ancestor of CSIDH based on the theory of complex multiplication on
    ordinary curves defined over finite fields.  Initially discovered
    by Couveignes in '97 [Cou06], was left unpublished and was
    independently rediscovered by [RS06].  [DKS18] introduce tweaks to
    the parameters to improve performance.

    Variant of CRS based on the action of $\mathrm{Cl}(\sqrt{-p})$ on
    supersingular curves defined over $\mathbb{F}_p$.  Original
    proposal with $p = 3 \bmod 8$ in [CL+18], minor variant wiht $p =
    7 \bmod 8$ in [CD19].

    Proof of knowledge and signature based on group actions. Usually

    Proof of knowledge and signature based on the SIDH assumption.
    Initially proposed in [DJP14]. [YA+17] adapts it into a signature,
    [DD+21] and [GK+21] fix mistakes in the security proof, [DD+21]
    introduces a variant with stronger soundness guarantees.

    Proof of knowledge and signature based on the weakSIDH assumption,
    i.e., the SIDH assumption without torsion point information.
