    Memory efficient version of MITM.  For a fixed amount of memory
    the best time complexity is $\exp(n)^{3/4}$. If memory scales with
    input size, time can scale anywhere between $\exp(n)^{3/4}$ and
    $\exp(n)^{1/2}$.

    Solves the isogeny problem with torsion point information (CSSI),
    assuming the endomorphism ring of the starting curve is special.

    [Kup04] describes a generic quantum algorithm to solve the hidden
    shift problem (equivalently, the dihedral hidden subgroup
    problem). [CJS13] uses Kuperberg's algorithm as a subroutine to
    attack the vectorization problem.
