    The problem of computing an isogeny of known degree given its
    action on a torsion subgroup of order coprime to the degree, as
    introduce in [JDF11] to claim security of SIDH.

    Same problem as CSSI, but the starting curve is random and the
    endomorphism ring is unknown to the attacker.  Folklore, first
    mentioned in [Pet17].

    Given two random supersingular curves, the problem of finding an
    isogeny walk between them. In some versions of the problem, one of
    the two curves is fixed. First considered in [CGL06]. Proven
    equivalent to the Endomorphism ring problem in [Wes21].

    Given a random supersingular curve, the problem of computing its

    Given two random supersingular curves over $\mathbb{F}_p$, find an
    isogeny of smooth degree between them. By random
    self-reducibility, this is equivalent to the problem where one of
    the two curves is fixed. The reduction to the Endomorphism ring
    problem over $\mathbb{F}_p$ was done in several steps in [CPV19],
    [Wes21].

    Given two random isogenous ordinary curves with isomorphic
    endomorphism rings, find an isogeny of smooth degree between
    them. By random self-reducibility, this is equivalent to the
    problem where one of the two curves is fixed.
