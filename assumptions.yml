    The problem of computing an isogeny of known degree given its
    action on a torsion subgroup of order coprime to the degree, as
    introduce in [JDF11] to claim security of SIDH.

    Same problem as CSSI, but the starting curve is random and the
    endomorphism ring is unknown to the attacker.  Folklore, first
    mentioned in [Pet17].

    Given two random supersingular curves, the problem of finding an
    isogeny walk between them. In some versions of the problem, one of
    the two curves is fixed. First considered in [CGL06]. Proven
    equivalent to the Endomorphism ring problem in [Wes21].

    Given a random supersingular curve, the problem of computing its

    random curves over a prime field $\mathbb{F}_p$.

    Given two random elements x₀, x₁ in a set acted upon transitively
    by a group G, find an element of G that maps x₀ to x₁. By random
    self-reducibility, this is equivalent to the problem where x₀ is
    fixed.

        The variant where the set is a set of supersingular curves
        defined over a prime field $\mathbb{F}_p$, and the set is the
        class group Cl(√-p). The reduction to the Endomorphism ring
        problem over $\mathbb{F}_p$ was done in steps in [CPV19] and
        [Wes21].

        The variant where the set is a set of supersingular curves
        with an *orientation* (an explicit embedding of a quadratic
        imaginary order into the endomorphism ring of the curve) and
        the group is the class group of the orientation.  Shown to be
        equivalent to O-EndRing in [Wes21].
