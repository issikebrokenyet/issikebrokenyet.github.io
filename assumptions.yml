    The problem of computing an isogeny of degree A between two random
    supersingular curves, given its action on a torsion subgroup of
    order B ≈ A, coprime A. First introduced in [JDF11] to claim
    security of SIDH, where A and B are powers of small primes, and
    then generalized in several works to cover general A and B.

        Variant of CSSI where one of the two curves is "special", in
        the sense that its endomorphism ring is known and contains
        endomorphisms of "small" norm.

    Given two random supersingular curves, the problem of finding an
    isogeny walk between them. In some versions of the problem, one of
    the two curves is fixed. First considered in [CGL06]. Proven
    equivalent to the Endomorphism ring problem in [Wes21].

        The variant of the isogeny path problem where the distance
        between the two curves in some isogeny graph is bounded away
        from the average distance of two random curves. [GP+16] proves
        that this problem heuristically reduces to the problem of
        finding paths of generic length.

    Given two random elements x₀, x₁ in a set acted upon transitively
    by a group G, find an element of G that maps x₀ to x₁. By random
    self-reducibility, this is equivalent to the problem where x₀ is
    fixed.

        The variant where the set is a set of supersingular curves
        with an *orientation* (an explicit embedding of a quadratic
        imaginary order into the endomorphism ring of the curve) and
        the group is the class group of the orientation.  Shown to be
        equivalent to O-EndRing in [Wes21].

    Given two supersingular isogenies $φ:E₀→E₁$ and $φ':E₂→E₃$ of the
    same degree $A$, and given an integer $B$ coprime to $A$, decide
    whether there exist isogenies $ψ:E₀→E₂$ and $ψ':E₁→E₃$ of degree
    $B$ such that $φ,φ′,ψ,ψ'$ form a commutative diagram.
